aim of having a legitamate blog that helps a few people. At the very least, I'd like it not to embarrass me or my family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content will revolve around science, python, and the intersection of the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a scientist working in a somwhate strange laboratory that is a mix 
between the French CNRS and the company Saint-Gobain. We do fundamental
research and develop technical expertise that should, in the best cases,
advance the level of materials science and help the research teams within the
company. Its a strange, but fun situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I became enamoured with Python during my grad school where I used it to 
build a model of light scattering in ceramic materials. I was shocked at
how easily it was to start from nothing and develop something useful. Today,
we are starting to use the IPython notebook for data analysis and teaching, but
I hope to expand our use of Python considerably. This blog will look at the 
progress we make, the solutions we find, and how we are able to spread Python.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="python"></category><category term="science"></category></entry></feed>
